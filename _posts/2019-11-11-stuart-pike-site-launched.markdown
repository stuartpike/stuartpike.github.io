Well, finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

The content well be on items have learnt on the journey to some kind of `Ops` be it `GitOps` or `DevOps`.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs]{:target="_blank"} for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]{:target="_blank"}. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk]{:target="_blank"}.
